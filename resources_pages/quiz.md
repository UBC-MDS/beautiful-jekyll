### Overview

With the exception of [project courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2019-08-22-project-courses/), MDS courses will have two quizzes throughout the block, typically one in the middle of the course and another after the course ends during the free days between blocks. The quizzes for a course will appear on the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) (ideally before the course starts) so that students are aware of the timing. We anticipate most quizzes being 50 minutes long.

### Purpose

The purpose of quizzes are to be a "sanity check" that students are keeping up with the essential material. While labs may go more in-depth into a topic, the quizzes cover essential material that we expect students to have mastered and to retain.

### Difficulty

In light of the purpose above, quizzes are intended to be less difficult than the labs. They are not meant to trick you nor to contain unexpected material. In short, if you did the labs without an unreasonable amount of collaboration with your classmates, you should succeed on the quizzes.

### Quiz Format and Platform

This year, quizzes will be held on PrairieLearn. Instead of quizzes being held at the same time for every student, we will provide quiz windows (available time slots) for students to register for their preferred time. Quizzes will feature randomized questions, so each student may receive a slightly different version of the quiz.

During the quiz window, students are **NOT** allowed to disclose, discuss, or share any part of the quiz with any other individual, except as directly permitted or required by the course instructors. This includes discussions in person, online, or through any electronic means. Violation of this policy will result in academic penalties, which may include failure of the quiz or failure of the course.

### Digital Cheatsheets

Students are now allowed to use digital cheatsheets, which must be uploaded to the PrairieLearn system. We trust that you will adhere to the guidelines when submitting your digital cheatsheets. Should we spot an "unreasonable" digital cheatsheet, we may request the **corresponding printed physical cheatsheet.** If it is deemed excessively unfair compared to others, penalties may be applied. The cheatsheet must be:

- **Requirements:** Confined to a **single, one-sided piece of letter-sized paper, 8.5 by 11 inches.** Please **do not** use legal or A4-sized paper
  - Letter-sized paper will be available in the labs if needed
- **Content format:** You may handwrite, type, or digitally create your cheatsheet, ensuring all information is **clearly readable when printed on letter-sized paper**
  - If you're typing your cheatsheet, ensure you use a minimum font size of 8 pt
- **Submission format:** The cheatsheet must be submitted as a **PNG file (not PDF)** with a file size of **5 MB or less.** This file size limit is enforced by PrairieLearn, not by us
  - You can create the PNG by scanning, photographing, or taking a screenshot of your cheatsheet
- **Resizing tools:** You can use Paint on Windows and Preview on Mac for basic resizing. Check out [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for more detailed adjustments such as resizing or format conversion, if needed
- **Naming convention:** File names of your digital cheatsheets should correspond with course names to avoid confusion
  - The file name for the 521 cheatsheet should be similar to `521_quiz_2_cheatsheet.png`
  - Please verify the **exact name** upon submission
- **Deadline:** digital cheatsheets are **due by 11:59 p.m.** the night before the quiz window opens
  - This is typically Monday night unless instructed otherwise
- **If a cheatsheet is found to be "unreasonable", i.e., the cheatsheet is not readable when printed on a letter-sized paper, you may be called in for a discussion and could face penalties**

Please remember that the primary goal is to understand the course material, not just to optimize your cheatsheets. Focusing on the concepts rather than the cheatsheet format will be far more beneficial for your quizzes and overall learning in the long run.

#### Instructions to Upload Cheatsheet

**Note**: Please use **Chrome** or **Firefox** to upload your cheatsheet. Other browsers may not work. If you haven’t installed these browsers, please refer to the [installation guide](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/) for instructions.

1. Log in to PrairieLearn and navigate to the course where you need to upload your cheatsheet.
2. Select the "Cheatsheet" assessment and open the corresponding upload question.
3. Upload your cheatsheet, ensuring it meets the cheatsheet [requirements](#digital-cheatsheets).
4. Click `Save & Grade` to submit your file.

### Quiz Results Review Session

To review your quiz results, you must register for a quiz review session on PrairieTest. These sessions will typically be available one week after the quiz, once all grading has been completed. Registration for the review session will follow the same process as registering for the quiz. During the review session, you will have access to the results of all quizzes from the previous week. You may also submit regrade requests at this time by clicking on `Report an issue with this question` (to the right of the question) and describing the your regrade request.
